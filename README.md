🖼️ Image-to-Text Converter using CNN

This project is an Image-to-Text Converter that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract and recognize text from images. It combines image preprocessing, deep learning, and optional OCR post-processing to convert input images into accurate, editable text.

✅ Features

---Convert images (JPG/PNG) to readable text

---CNN-based text recognition model

---Supports custom datasets or printed/handwritten text

 ---Preprocessing (noise removal, grayscale, thresholding, etc.)

---Easy-to-use Python script

---Saves extracted text to a .txt file or displays directly on screen

💡 Future Improvements

---Improve accuracy for handwritten text

---Add a GUI or Web App using Streamlit/Flask

---Support for multiple languages

---Train using larger datasets like IAM, MNIST, or custom datasets
