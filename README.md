This project is an Image-to-Text Converter that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract and recognize text from images. It combines image processing, deep learning, and optional OCR post-processing to convert input images into accurate, editable text.
 Features

✅ Convert images (JPG/PNG) to readable text
✅ CNN-based text recognition model
✅ Supports custom datasets or printed/handwritten text
✅ Preprocessing for noise removal, grayscale, thresholding, etc.
✅ Easy-to-use Python script
✅ Saves extracted text into a .txt or displays on screen


💡 Future Improvements

Improve accuracy for handwritten text

Add GUI or Web App (Streamlit/Flask)

Support for multiple languages

Train with larger datasets like IAM or MNIST text
